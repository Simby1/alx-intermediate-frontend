Prerequisites
First, I made sure to have Node.js, nvm and npm installed on my computer. I confirmed their installation by opening my terminal and typing these commands:

Bash

node -v
npm -v

Local Installation of SASS for my Project

1. Navigating to My Project
   I used the cd (change directory) command to get inside my project's main folder from the alx-intermediate-frontend project folder.

Bash

cd 0x03-sass_scss

2. Initializing my Project
   To keep track of my project's dependencies, I initialized it with npm that created a package.json file.

Bash

npm init -y

3. Installing Sass
   Next, I installed Sass specifically for this project. It's a development tool, so I installed it as a dev dependency.

Bash

npm install --save-dev sass

This command installs Sass into my project's node_modules folder and adds it to the "devDependencies" list in my package.json file.
