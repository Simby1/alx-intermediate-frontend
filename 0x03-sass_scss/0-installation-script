Prerequisites
First, I made sure to have Node.js, nvm and npm installed on my computer. I confirmed their installation by opening my terminal and typing these commands:

Bash

node -v
npm -v

Local Installation of SASS for my Project

1. Navigating to My Project
   I used the cd (change directory) command to get inside my project's main folder from the alx-intermediate-frontend project folder.

Bash

cd 0x03-sass_scss

2. Initializing my Project
   To keep track of my project's dependencies, I initialized it with npm that created a package.json file.

Bash

npm init -y

3. Installing Sass
   Next, I installed Sass specifically for this project.

Bash

npm install sass

This command installs Sass into my project's node_modules folder and adds it to the "devDependencies" list in my package.json file.

4. Start Compiling
   Now that Sass is installed, I ran the Sass compiler. I added a script to my package.json file to make it easy.

JSON

"scripts": {
"sass": "sass src/styles.scss:dist/styles.css"
}
Then, I can run it from my terminal with:

Bash

npm run sass
This command takes my Sass file (src/styles.scss) and compiles it into a regular CSS file (dist/styles.css).
